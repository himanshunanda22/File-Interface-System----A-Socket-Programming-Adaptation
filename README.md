# File Content Management Server

This Python project implements a simple server-client interaction for managing file contents with user authorization. The server listens for incoming connections from clients, verifies user credentials, and allows authorized users to load and save file contents.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the `server.py` and `client.py` files.

2. Place the `server.py` file on a computer that will act as the server and the `client.py` file on the client computer(s).

3. Ensure both the server and clients have the same set of authorized user credentials and file paths (modify the `authorized_users` and `file_contents` dictionaries in the code as needed).

4. Run the server script on the server computer using the following command:

   ```bash
   python server.py
Run the client script on client computers using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python client.py
Features
Server-client architecture for managing file contents.
User authentication with predefined credentials.
Load and save file contents on the server.
Usage
Clients connect to the server and provide login credentials (username and password).
The server verifies the credentials against the predefined authorized users.
If authorized, clients can perform the following actions:
Load: Clients can request to load the contents of a file on the server.
Save: Clients can request to save new contents to a file on the server.
The server responds to client requests accordingly.
Customization
You can customize the following aspects of this project:

Authorized Users: Modify the authorized_users dictionary in the server.py file to add or remove authorized users and their passwords.
File Contents: Modify the file_contents dictionary in the server.py file to define initial file contents or add new file paths.
Dependencies
Python 3.x

You can create a README.md file in the same directory as your project files (both `server.py` and `client.py`) and paste the above content into it. This README.md file provides an overview of your project, instructions on how to run it, its features, customization options, and license information. Feel free to further customize it to suit your project's needs.
